            This is a personal site designed for use in ESL classrooms. As
            someone with qualifications in education, web development and
            machine learning, my ultimate goal is to venn-diagram those three
            realms and build a bespoke resource for my ESL students to enjoy.
          </p>
          <p>
            Initially, this site will provide a collection of external resources
            that I reckon students will find useful. As time goes, I plan to add
            additional site functionality, along with access to applications
            I've built myself. It might not happen overnight, but it will
            happen! üòÖ
